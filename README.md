# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Overview
This project is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It allows two players to play the game on the same computer. The game updates the board after each move and checks for a winner or a draw condition after every move.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay on the same computer.
- Simple and intuitive text-based user interface.
- Dynamic board updates after each move.
- Automatic win/draw detection.

## Game Instructions
- The game board consists of 9 tiles numbered 1 through 9.
- Each player takes turns to enter the number of the tile they wish to mark.
- Player 1 marks tiles with 'X' and Player 2 marks tiles with 'O'.
- The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all tiles are filled and no player has 3 marks in a line, the game is a draw.

## Code Structure
- `main()` - Initializes the game and handles player turns and input.
- `board()` - Renders the game board in the console.
- `checkwin()` - Checks for a winner or a draw.
